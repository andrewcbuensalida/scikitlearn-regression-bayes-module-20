## Part 1

To determine the best version of Naïve Bayes for each dataset, we need to consider the nature of the features:

1. **Spam Prediction Dataset 1**:
   - **Best Version**: Multinomial Naïve Bayes
   - **Reasoning**: This dataset contains integer counts of words (e.g., "Free", "Credit", "Yours", "Money") in emails. Multinomial Naïve Bayes is well-suited for text classification problems where features represent the frequency of words or terms.

2. **Spam Prediction Dataset 2**:
   - **Best Version**: Binomial Naïve Bayes
   - **Reasoning**: This dataset contains binary features (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of specific words in emails. Binomial Naïve Bayes is appropriate for binary/boolean features, making it the best choice for this dataset.

3. **Flower Type Prediction Dataset**:
   - **Best Version**: Gaussian Naïve Bayes
   - **Reasoning**: This dataset contains continuous numerical features (e.g., "Stem Length", "Flower Width", "Flower Length"). Gaussian Naïve Bayes is designed for continuous data and assumes that the features follow a normal distribution, making it suitable for this dataset.

In summary, Multinomial Naïve Bayes is best for Dataset 1, Binomial Naïve Bayes for Dataset 2, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes for the Flower Type Prediction Dataset.


## Part 2

The Car Prices of Poland dataset contains 118k+ offers of cars in Poland from Jan.2022. Some of the columns include price, city, fuel, mileage, model, etc. 

To predict the price of cars using Naïve Bayes, the Gaussian Naïve Bayes version is the most appropriate. This is because Gaussian Naïve Bayes is suitable for continuous data, and the price is a continuous variable. The other versions, binomial and multinomial, are more suited for categorical data. Binomial Naïve Bayes is used for binary classification, while Multinomial Naïve Bayes is used for discrete counts, such as word frequencies in text classification.

For predicting the price using Gaussian Naïve Bayes, the following columns can be used as features:

1. **Year**: The manufacturing year of the car.
2. **Mileage**: The total distance the car has traveled.
3. **Vol_engine**: The engine volume, which is a continuous variable.
4. **Fuel**: Although categorical, it can be encoded numerically.
5. **City**: The location where the car is being sold, which can also be encoded.
6. **Province**: Similar to the city, it can be encoded numerically.

These features provide a mix of continuous and categorical data that can be encoded and used to predict the continuous target variable, price, using Gaussian Naïve Bayes.
